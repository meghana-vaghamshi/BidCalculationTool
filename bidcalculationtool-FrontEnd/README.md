### API Configuration
If your API runs on a different port, you need to update the URL in the `.env` file to connect the Vue application to the API. 

1. Open the `.env` file in the root of your project.
2. Locate the line that specifies the API URL "VUE_APP_API_URL".
3. Change 'http://localhost:5139/' to the appropriate host and port where your API is running.
Make sure to restart the development server after making changes to the `.env` file for the changes to take effect.

### Customize configuration
See [Configuration Reference](https://cli.vuejs.org/config/).
